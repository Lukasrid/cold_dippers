            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>Founded in 2018 the Cold Dippers is a small but ever growing community of people who are learning to
                embrace the cold in order to fortify their mind and body.
                <br><br>
                The founders of the community were inspired by the ancient Tibetan Buddhist practice of <a
                    href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tummo">Tummo</a> which includes
                meditation and breathing practices to build an inner fire and overcome the cold. With a similair and
                more modern approach, <a href="https://www.wimhofmethod.com/">Wim Hof</a>
                continued to draw out their curiosities of cold exposure with his own developed breath retention method
                nicknamed the Wim Hof Method. Following down this already paved
                path the founders soon experienced firsthand the power that comes with these practices.
                <br><br>
                What started off with a simple word of mouth soon gained traction with friends and
                curious strangers which has led to this flourishing community of people who want to overcome the
                boundaries of their own comfort to achive feats which many people have
                deemed to be an impossible or dangerous task.
                <br><br>
                Here at the Cold Dippers we put safety above all else to ensure that we can all reap the benefits of
                these practices. Anyone is welcome to come and participate, observe or
                ask questions at any of our events or meet-up. We have a strong policy to provide support instead of
                pressure for anyone who wishes to take the plunge. The
                experience tends to push people out of their comfort zones in the beginning, which is an important step
                for when you are trying to make a change to your body and
                mind. We will teach you methods that can be practiced on site or at home to help you prepare your body
                and mind to get comfortable with the immersion into cold water.
                <br><br>
                It is a powerful experience that will mould you into something greater and more resilient, it will help
                start unlocking your ultimate human potential.
