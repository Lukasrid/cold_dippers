                Thats that human survival instinct kicking in. The cold is something that most of us have been taught to
                avoid at all costs, but this has ended up
                costing us more harm than good. Research and personal expriences have shown that regular exposure to the
                cold can help quiet a stressful mind, improve
                your immune system, increase production of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brown_adipose_tissue">
                    <p>brown adipose tissue (brown fat)</p>
                </a> which burns up
                normal white fat cell to produce body heat. Like with any new venture this proccess takes time,
                dedication and a strong mindset. Through the
                Cold Dippers community we aim to provide support and motivation to help <em>YOU</em> reach your ultimate
                human potential! We welcome you into our cool family,
                so come take your first steps on this journey of discovery, come take the plunge,
